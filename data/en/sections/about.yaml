# a summary about you
summary: |
  I am a multidisciplinary educator and learning designer working across higher and executive education. My work focuses on transforming complex material into accessible, well-structured learning experiences, with particular attention to Universal Design for Learning and accessibility compliance (WCAG 2).

  I am currently completing a BSocSci (Hons) in Psychology at the South African College of Applied Psychology, following a BSocSci in Psychology and Philosophy at the University of Cape Town, alongside earlier training in sound production and music performance. My research investigates the relationship between AI tool usage and self-efficacy among tertiary students with ADHD in South Africa.
