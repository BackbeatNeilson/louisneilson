# 8. Citation and Reference Practices

## APA 7th
Use APA in-text citations whenever possible and provide a reference list at the end of authored material.

## Outside APA
Use superscript, hyperlinked footnotes following Wikipedia-style conventions.  
If superscripts cannot render, use parenthetical citations as fallback.

Return to the [manual index](./).
