# 3. Typography and Symbols

## Dash and Hyphen Spacing
Hyphens, en dashes, and em dashes never take surrounding spaces.

## Hyphen "-"
`ALT + 0045` / Unicode: `U+002D`  
Used for compound terms such as self-efficacy.  
The standard keyboard hyphen is acceptable.

## En Dash "–"
`ALT + 0150` / Unicode: `U+2013`  
Used for ranges such as 5–10 km or 19th–20th century.

## Em Dash "—"
`ALT + 0151` / Unicode: `U+2014`  
Used for emphatic parenthetical insertions and clause-level clarifications. Never spaced.

## Ellipsis "…"
`ALT + 0133` / Unicode: `U+2026`

## Multiplication Sign "×"
`ALT + 0215` / Unicode: `U+00D7`  
Use the multiplication sign rather than the letter x for mathematical notation.

## Minus Sign "−"
No alt code exists. Unicode: `U+2212`  
Preferred mathematical minus sign.

## Slash Compounds
The forward slash denotes alternation (or).  
Correct usage: and/or; input/output.  
Incorrect for relational meaning: student/teacher → use student-teacher instead.  
See also: [Grammar and Writing Style → Slash Compounds in Prose](../grammar-and-writing/#slash-compounds-in-prose).

## Bold and Italics
Bold is the only accepted form of emphasis.  
Italics are reserved for non-English words, Latin phrases, and quoted or referenced terms.  
Italics are never used for emphasis.

## Unicode Symbols
Use typographically correct symbols wherever possible.

## Text Justification
Prefer left-justified text. Avoid systems that introduce extreme word-stretching.
