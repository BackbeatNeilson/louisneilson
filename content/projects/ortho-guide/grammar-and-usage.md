# 5. Grammar and Usage

## Pronouns
Use *they* as default singular pronoun unless an individual’s gender is explicitly known and relevant.

## Contractions
Never use contractions.

## Slash compounds in prose
Allowed only when the slash means “or”.  
Avoid slash compounds for relationships or roles.

## Avoiding formulaic transitions
No signposting such as “In this section…”.  
Avoid clichés.  
Dictionary definitions appear only when explicitly requested.

## Lists
Lists are acceptable where they enhance clarity.  
Numbered lists indicate order or when the lead-in indicates a specific number.  
Bulleted lists indicate unordered sets.  
List items wrap under their own indent.
