# 4. Numbers, Dates, and Measurement

## Words vs Numerals
Write out one through ten unless immediately followed by a unit or symbol.  
Examples: three participants; 5%; 10° Celsius; 3 pm.

## Percentages
Always use the % sign with an Arabic numeral.

## Time Notation
Use lowercase h, m, and s in 24-hour notation.  
Examples: 13h00; 13h21m48s.  
Avoid colon-separated time (13:21:48) and avoid am/pm or “o’clock”.

## Dates
Numeric dates use leading zeros and hyphens: 02-12-2025.  
Order: day–month–year.  
Long-form example: Tuesday, 2nd December 2025.

## Thousands and Decimals
Thousands separator: comma  
Decimal separator: full stop

## Ranges
Use en dashes and place the unit after the range: 5–10 km.

## APA Numerical Conventions
Values bounded by ±1 omit the leading zero (r = .389).  
Round to three decimals unless APA requires otherwise, e.g. SD and M.  
Use M when following APA; use x̄ when APA formatting does not apply.
