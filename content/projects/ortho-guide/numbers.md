# 3. Numbers

## Words vs numerals
Write out *one* through *ten*, unless immediately followed by a unit or symbol:  
• *three participants*  
• *5%*, *10° Celsius*, *3 pm*

## Percentages
Always use Arabic numeral + % sign.

## Time notation
Use lowercase unit letters and 24-hour notation:  
• 13h00  
• 13h21m48s  
Avoid colon-separated formats (13:21:48) and avoid am/pm or “o’clock”.  
Colons are preferred for ratios, not for time.

## Dates
Numeric dates use hyphens and leading zeros:  
• 02-12-2025  
Order is always day–month–year.

Long-form dates use weekday + ordinal day + month + year:  
• Tuesday, 2nd December 2025

## Thousands and decimals
Thousands separator is a comma.  
Decimal separator is a full stop.

## Ranges
Write as *5–10 km* with the unit placed after the full range.  
Always use en dashes for ranges.

## APA-specific numerical norms
Values limited to ±1 omit the leading zero: *r = .389*.  
Round to three decimals unless APA mandates otherwise.  
Use **M** for APA-compliant means; use x̄ when APA formatting does not apply.
