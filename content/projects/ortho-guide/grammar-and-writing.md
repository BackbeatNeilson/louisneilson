# 6. Grammar and Writing Style

## Pronouns
Use they as the default singular pronoun unless the person’s gender is explicitly known and relevant; i.e., instead of “he/she” say “they”.

## Contractions
Never use contractions.

## Slash Compounds in Prose
Allowed only when the slash denotes alternation (and/or, input/output).  
Avoid slash constructions that distort relational meaning.

## Avoiding Formulaic Transitions
Do not use signposting such as “In this section…”.  
Avoid clichés.  
Provide dictionary definitions only when explicitly requested.

## Lists
Lists are acceptable when they enhance clarity.  
Numbered lists indicate sequence; bulleted lists indicate unordered sets.  
List items wrap naturally under their own indent.

## Latin Abbreviations
Latin abbreviations are treated as natural English.  
Follow the [Abbreviation Period Rule](../punctuation/#abbreviation-period-rule) in the Punctuation section.
