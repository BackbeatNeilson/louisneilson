# 1. Orthography

## Regional standard
South African English is the default for spelling, lexical choices, and grammatical conventions.

## Spelling conventions
Use *-ise* rather than *-ize*.  
Retain British forms such as *colour*, *harbour*, and *behaviour*.  
Avoid Americanised variants.

## Naturalised loanwords
Words that have become established in English (*café*, *naïve*, *fiancé*, *schadenfreude*) do not receive italics.

## Non-English words in prose
All non-English words embedded in prose are italicised every time, not only on first occurrence.

## Capitalisation
Follow APA 7th for title case except that all prepositions remain lowercase regardless of length.  
Use capitalisation to distinguish proper names of academic or professional disciplines (**Psychology**) from general mental-process terms (**psychology**).  
Capitals follow normal rules for proper nouns.

## Capitalising *The* in names
*The* is capitalised only when it forms part of the official name.

Examples:  
• *the* Republic of South Africa  
• *The* Gambia  
• *the* Netherlands  
• *The* Hague

## Century formatting
Use *19th century* and *19th-century theorists*.  
Superscript ordinal suffixes may be used only if accessibility is not compromised.
