# 4. Punctuation

## Quotation marks
Double quotation marks for full quotations.  
Single quotation marks for nested quotations or isolated linguistic terms.  
Example: “Joe said, ‘Are you sure about that?’”.

## Oxford comma
Always used.

## Ampersand (&)
Use “and” in all prose.  
Use “&” only within list clauses to create internal pairings:  
*shoes & coat, oranges, tutu, guns & ammunition, and a cake*.

## Mathematical operators
Use spacing around operators: *x + y = z*.  
Prefer LaTeX or MathJax where available.

## Possessives and plurals
Names ending in *s* take only an apostrophe: *Louis’ chair*.  
Plurals do not use apostrophes: *As*, *Bs*, *1990s*.
