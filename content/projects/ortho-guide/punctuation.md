# 5. Punctuation

## Quotation Marks
Double quotation marks for full quotations.  
Single quotation marks for nested quotations or referenced terms.  
Example: “Joe said, ‘Are you sure about that?’”.

## Oxford Comma
Always used.

## Ampersand (&)
Use “and” in prose. Use “&” only to create internal sub-pairings.  
Example: shoes & coat, oranges, tutu, guns & ammunition, and a cake.

## Mathematical Operators
Use spacing around operators: x + y = z.  
MathJax is first preference: https://www.mathjax.org/#gettingstarted  
LaTeX is second preference.

## Possessives and Plurals
Names ending in s take only an apostrophe: Louis’ chair.  
Plurals do not use apostrophes: As, Bs, 1990s.

## Abbreviation Period Rule
• If the abbreviation ends with the final letter of the full word, omit the period (Dr).  
• If not, include the period (Prof.).  
*et al.* retains the period on *al.* because it abbreviates *alii*.
