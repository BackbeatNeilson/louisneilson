# 2. Typography

## General dash and hyphen spacing rule
Hyphens, en dashes, and em dashes never take surrounding spaces in this system.

## Hyphen
Joins compound terms such as *self-efficacy*.  
Produced by the standard hyphen key.

## En dash – `ALT + 0150`
Indicates numerical or conceptual ranges:  
• *5–10 km*  
• *19th–20th century*

## Em dash — `ALT + 0151`
Used for emphatic parenthetical insertions, clause-level clarifications, and strong explanatory breaks after short introductory phrases.  
Never spaced.

## Ellipsis … `ALT + 0133`
Use the Unicode ellipsis and apply sparingly.

## Slash compounds
The forward slash denotes alternation (“or”).  
Correct examples: *and/or*, *input/output*.  
Do not use for relational meaning: write *student-teacher interaction*, not *student/teacher interaction*.

## Bold and italics
Bold is the only form of emphasis.  
Italics are reserved for:  
• Non-English words  
• Latin expressions  
• Referenced terms or quoted single words  
Never use italics for emphasis.

## Unicode symbols
Use typographically correct symbols when possible: minus sign −, multiplication sign × `ALT + 0215`, proper quotation marks, and en and em spaces where useful.  
Avoid hyphen-minus as a substitute.

## Text justification
Prefer left-justified text.  
Avoid systems that introduce extreme word-stretching.
