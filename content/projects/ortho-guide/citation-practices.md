# 7. Citation Practices

## APA 7th
Use APA in-text citations whenever possible in academic writing.  
Provide a reference list at the end of authored material.

## Outside APA
Use superscript, hyperlinked footnotes following Wikipedia-style conventions.  
If superscripts cannot render, use parenthetical citations as fallback.

## Latin abbreviations
Treat as natural English.  
Use the rule:  
• If the abbreviation ends with the last letter of the full word, no period (*Dr*).  
• If not, include a period (*Prof.*).  
*et al.* retains a period on *al.* because it abbreviates *alii*.
