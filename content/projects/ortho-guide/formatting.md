# 6. Formatting Conventions

## Paragraphing
Use indented paragraphs rather than block spacing.

## Block quotes
Block quotes longer than forty words appear as APA-style indented blocks without quotation marks.  
In Markdown, use “>” but rely on CSS or rendering rules so that the visual result matches APA styling.  
Callouts may be used as needed.

## Preferred authoring environment order
1. Plain text  
2. Markdown  
3. R  
4. Python  
5. JavaScript  
6. HTML/CSS  
7. Other formats

## Formal structures
Provide set notation or syllogistic forms after the prose argument when conceptually appropriate.
