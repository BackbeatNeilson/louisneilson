# 7. Document Structure and Formatting

## Paragraphing
Use indented paragraphs rather than spaced block paragraphs.

## Block Quotes
Block quotes longer than forty words appear without quotation marks and are rendered APA-style.  
In Markdown, “>” may be used but should be styled to resemble APA formatting.  
Callouts (e.g., GitHub `[!NOTE]`) are acceptable where appropriate.

## Formal Structures
Provide set notation or syllogistic structures after the prose discussion when conceptually appropriate
